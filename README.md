# Basic Arithmetic Parser
An extremely basic arithmetic parser built in Rust.

## Features
#### 1. Parses Mathematical Expressions
- 45 + 55 -> Output: `100`
- 4 * 35 -> Output: `140`
- 57 - 5 -> Output: `52`
- 70 / 2 -> Output: `35`

#### 2. Chained Expressions
- 45 + 55 / 2 -> Output: `50`
- 4 * 35 / 5 -> Output: `28`

**Note:** There's no operator precedence; it's just simple left-to-write evaluation.


### Note 
Do not have any high expectations from this repo, as it's purely meant for me to practice parsing and lexing, and getting comfortable with Rust.
